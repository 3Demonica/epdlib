    "EpdLib is a library for creating dynamically scaled screen layouts for frame-buffered devices such as e-paper/e-ink displays. Complex layouts are defined as image or text blocks. Using epdlib blocks makes it trivial to develop for different disiplay resolutions as layouts are aware of thier resolution and scale the blocks dynamically to match the available area.\n",
